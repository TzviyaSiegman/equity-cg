## Draft Definitions

From AGWG Equity sub-group work: https://github.com/w3c/silver/wiki/Equity-Framework#definition-description 

Equity is a process and an outcome.

“Equality is equal access, while ‘equity’ is equal outcomes.” [Antoinette Carroll, Creative Reaction Lab Founder]

Merriam-Webster ‘Equity’ and ‘Equality’ - “Sameness or equal distribution are the principal denotations of equality.” This aligns with the working definition of accessibility, that those have access. Equity adds “justice, fairness, and impartiality, the principal denotations of equity.” With equity we aim to restore justice.
